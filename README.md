# collegeSmart
This website is built with Flask and Python. It is a simple website meant to assist Sailors through the initial process of becoming eligible for Tuition Assistance and answer questions I had when first trying to determine how to go through the process.

This Flask application is currently deployed to https://collegesmart.herokuapp.com/
